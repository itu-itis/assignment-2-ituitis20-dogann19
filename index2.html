				<h3>Traditional Water Fight</h3>
					<p>Every year, after the second exams, all students fight in the garden of school. Some of them bring lots of water balloons or nerfs. Others buy all water bottles in the school's canteen and pierce the caps of bottles. This has become a tradition of our school and also teachers attend in it. </p>

				<h3>Traditional Reunion</h3>
					<p>Each year, alumni of Beşiktaş Anatolian High School visit here and meet with their high school friends and also have a chance to meet other alumni before the new education year starts. In this activity, they can attend various entertainments and be a member of society. Special of this day is rice of course.</p>

				<h3>Graduation Ceremony</h3>
					<p>Students who will graduate in that year prepare a march that contains behaviours of teachers, criticism about school management and their specific memories in Beşiktaş Anatolian High School. In addition to that, they prepare banners about school by themselves in order to hang on walls. After singing the anthem together and dancing with songs, they jump into the cold Marmara Sea. Some alumni who graduated a year ago come with a boat and greet new graduated students.

				<h4>About myself</h4>
				<p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Nadide Bilge Doğan but I prefer Bilge. I graduated from Beşiktaş Anatolian High School in 2019 and this is my second term in the Computer engineering department due to the fact that I'm an irregular student.  Why did I choose this department? Actually, I had not made  any decision about which profession I wanted. After the results of the university entrance exam, I thought about this but did not decide because of confusion. I still do not know which was the best for me but I am trying to not  let my family notice :) I did not want a career in medicine as a consequence I chose this department. This is not a single reason. I am interested in coding, robotics and space also. Learning new things and always staying as a student, define me. I have some plans for the future but before that I have to improve myself.
